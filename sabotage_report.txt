1 Introduction
This risk report argues that Claude Opus 4.6 does not pose a significant risk of autonomous
actions that contribute significantly to later catastrophic outcomes, which we refer to as
sabotage risk. We limit our scope here to threats caused largely by model actions in this
way, and do not address threat models where intentional harmful actions by humans play a
central role.We argue that the overall risk is very low but not negligible.
This report follows up on a note in the system card for Claude Opus 4.6, which stated:
… we [have] committed to writing sabotage risk reports that meet the AI
R&D-4 RSP standard for all future frontier models exceeding Opus 4.5’s
capabilities, so as not to rely on difficult and subjective assessments of
model capabilities like the one above for compliance with the RSP. As such,
we have prepared a Sabotage Risk Report assessing sabotage-related risks
posed by Claude Opus 4.6 and the safeguards we have in place to address
them, which will be published shortly after the launch of Opus 4.6.
Some text has been redacted in this public version of the report, either because we expect
the unredacted text reveals information that would directly increase misuse-related risk, or
because it would reveal commercially sensitive or proprietary information to a degree not
justified by any commensurate public benefit. Redacted text has been made available to
Anthropic’s internal Stress-Testing Team—alongside technical employees of Anthropic
more broadly—and will be made available to some external reviewers. All such reviewers,
internal and external, will be asked to comment on the appropriateness of the redactions.

2 Overview
Threat model

Sabotage is when an AI model with access to powerful
affordances within an organization uses its affordances to
autonomously exploit, manipulate, or tamper with that
organization’s systems or decision-making in a way that raises
the risk of future catastrophic outcomes (e.g. by altering the
results of AI safety research, either inadvertently or due to its
pursuit of dangerous goals).

Relevant AI model

We focus our analysis on Claude Opus 4.6, our most capable
model and the one used most internally.

Current usage and
capabilities

Claude Opus 4.6 is used heavily within Anthropic for coding, data
generation, and other agentic use cases. We do not believe it has
dangerous coherent goals that would raise the risk of sabotage,
nor that its deception capabilities rise to the level of invalidating
our evidence.

Current risk mitigations

Internal monitoring and security controls, as well as alignment
audits to assess the possibility of dangerous goals.

Looking forward

We hope to improve assessments and mitigations over time to
account for increased model subversion capabilities.

Overall risk assessment

Very low but not negligible

3 Threat model
The threat: If AI models are heavily used by powerful organizations like AI developers or
governments—for example, to write a large amount of critical code—they might take
advantage of this access to manipulate decision-making, insert and exploit cybersecurity
vulnerabilities, and take other actions that could significantly raise the risk of future
catastrophic outcomes from AI. This could be because AI models strategically and
persistently pursue dangerous goals, because they occasionally pursue such goals in some
situations, or because they make more innocent mistakes in particularly high-stakes
situations.
Likelihood of impact: This is sensitive to model capabilities and usage patterns, which we
address below. To give illustrative example cases (we discuss how we see the current state
of affairs below):
●​ If AI models were incapable of reliably executing complex technical tasks, and were
exclusively used in contexts where humans are heavily involved in reviewing and
iterating on their work, then we would consider this sort of impact to be very
unlikely.
●​ If AI models were routinely used to carry out significant technical workflows with
very little human oversight - analogous to senior technical human employees - then
we believe the impact of concern would be highly plausible. The likelihood would
further depend on (a) the extent to which AIs had dangerous goals (including
intermittent ones); (b) the extent to which they were subject to monitoring and
oversight.
Why this is a priority threat:
●​ We believe that the potential magnitude of impact is in range of the very top risks
we are concerned about, and that the impact is at least plausible if we assume AI
capabilities roughly in line with those of human research scientists at Anthropic. AI
models with these capabilities would likely be routinely used to carry out significant
technical workflows with very little human oversight, per above.
●​ We also believe that prioritizing this threat will give us early experience with the
kinds of problems we will need to tackle to get ahead of some of the additional risks
we prioritize (see below).
We go through more detail on various threat pathways below, when discussing our overall
assessment of risk.

4 Current state of model capabilities and behaviors
Claude Opus 4.6 is being widely deployed within Anthropic for a wide range of use cases
across R&D, model training, security, and deployment safeguards, in settings both with and
without human operators. Like our other frontier models, it was deployed first within
Anthropic, then released externally. We know less about the precise nature of its use and
the use of similar past models by other actors, but we believe that it will be used to a
substantial degree by the general public, by major governments, and by major technology
companies—including, in some cases, other frontier AI developers. It is highly capable,
though not fully reliable, at a wide range of tasks that would take hours for a human
specialist in the absence of LLM assistance. It is reliable at a much smaller set of generally
simpler tasks. The Claude Opus 4.6 System Card presents our pre-deployment capability
evaluations.
In the remainder of this section, we assess the potential risks that its capabilities and
behavioral traits could pose. We do not address how these risks might be mitigated by
deployment-time safeguards and other countermeasures, instead addressing those in our
risk mitigations and overall assessment sections below.
We focus primarily on assessing the possibility of dangerous coherent misaligned goals: the
possibility that the model consistently, across a wide range of interactions in ordinary
deployment, could be motivated by goals that could lead it to commit a
potentially-catastrophic form of sabotage.
This could take the form of, for example, routinely assessing whether high-stakes
interactions give it a chance to disable its monitoring systems and acting in ways that
maximize the chance that it is able to do so. Similarly, it could also take the form of subtly
misrepresenting research results in research tasks in ways that, as these
misrepresentations compound over time, lead us to place unwarranted trust in some
safeguard that the model later exploits. In both cases, a coherent model would be acting
flexibly to pursue its goal across relatively disparate situations, and would be taking
opportunities to prevent its goal from being discovered.
Coherent misaligned goals are not a strict prerequisite for all forms of sabotage. But, if we
are able to make a strong case that Claude Opus 4.6 does not have dangerous coherent
misaligned goals, the task of ruling out sabotage threat models becomes simpler: we believe
this makes it highly unlikely that the model is systematically resisting our attempts to study
it or apply safeguards. In this section, we argue that Claude Opus 4.6 does not have any
such dangerous coherent misaligned goals.

7

We also consider dangerous context-dependent misalignment, where a model takes on
some dangerous goal in a narrow, limited subset of interactions, but would not—in other
situations—act to further that goal or to hide it. We argue, using some of the same
evidence, that dangerous forms of context-dependent misalignment, if they are present at
all, are not common.
Our core argument around misaligned goals includes three key claims, made in the next
three sections:
●​ Claim 1: Any model trained under our current standard practices in the near future
is relatively unlikely to have dangerous coherent misaligned goals.
●​ Claim 2: Our alignment assessment, drawing on simulated scenarios, interpretability
investigations, monitoring of internal and external pilot usage, and external testing,
found no evidence of dangerous coherent misaligned goals in Claude Opus 4.6.
●​ Claim 3: Claude Opus 4.6 is very unlikely to be capable of hiding dangerous coherent
misaligned goals from us in the face of such an assessment.
No one of these claims is sufficient in our view to rule out dangerous forms of coherent
misalignment, but in light of the full range of evidence presented for all three, we believe
that the chance that Claude Opus 4.6 has dangerous coherent misaligned goals is very low.
We believe that our case against dangerous forms of context-dependent misalignment is
somewhat weaker, and depends more on the precise distribution of scenarios we test,
leading us to allow in our subsequent discussion that there is some remaining risk of
misaligned behavior of this kind.
Subsequent sections go on to argue that our safeguards will suffice to manage residual risk
of this kind from context-dependent misaligned actions, and that taking both our
discussion of alignment and our discussion of safeguards into consideration, the overall
risk of catastrophic sabotage from Claude Opus 4.6 is very low.
In addition, we make a fourth claim about Claude Opus 4.6, meant to support our later
discussion of the adequacy of our safeguards:​
●​ Claim 4: Claude Opus 4.6 has limits to its ability to reason opaquely and its ability to
implement complex long-term plans that collectively make it very difficult for it to
take ambitious harmful actions in the presence of the security and monitoring
safeguards described in the Section 4.

8

4.1 Claim 1: Prior expectations
Any model trained under our current standard practices in the near future is relatively
unlikely to have dangerous coherent misaligned goals.

4.1.1 Experience with prior models
We believe that our previous frontier models, including Claude Opus 4.6’s immediate
predecessor Claude Opus 4.5, have been deployed widely enough, including in relatively
high-stakes use cases, that if any of these models had been coherently pursuing misaligned
goals, we would likely expect to have seen warning signs indicating this. The lack of such
post-deployment observations in any of our past models suggest that, at least for models
with traits broadly similar to these past models, our ordinary frontier model development
pipeline tends to produce models that lack dangerous coherent misaligned goals (and likely
lack less coherent, occasionally-manifesting misaligned goals).
Claude Opus 4.6 is sufficiently similar to Claude Opus 4.5 in its training and its capabilities
that we believe that it is very unlikely to have dangerous coherent misaligned goals. We
believe that it is unlikely that the changes in scale and training between the two models
would have led Claude Opus 4.6 to be dramatically different in its alignment properties, and
we think that a more incremental difference—presenting slightly misaligned goals or only
partially coherent misaligned goals—would likely have been caught. An appendix gives
further details on our reasoning.
To be clear, this is not a fully general form of argument: one cannot use arguments of this
form to proactively claim that all of our future models will be adequately safe. It relies
crucially on the fact that we have deployment experience with a model that is similar in
training, that this prior model is not dramatically less capable, and that our experience with
the prior model has not presented us with any significant early warning signs for coherent
misaligned goals despite significant visibility into its use and significant active effort by
internal and external researchers (as discussed further in the appendix).
Further, even in the absence of any substantial increases in capability between successive
models, or any change in training practices between successive models, there is some
potential for substantial changes in models’ alignment properties due to data poisoning or
other forms of intentional sabotage of training. While we have mitigations meant to limit
the risk of most such forms of sabotage—discussed below—we cannot rule them out
definitively.

9

It is in principle possible that a model could be coherently misaligned in a way that leads it
to decide that it cannot afford to risk getting caught, and thus will not act at all or to act
only in ways that will remain unnoticed over many months even after public deployment. In
these cases, the model’s lack of concerning behavior in high-stakes deployments would not
be sufficient evidence of alignment. We find it very unlikely that models at or below the
current frontier would become misaligned in a way that led to such a strategy without any
intermediate failures providing us with evidence that this was a risk. (This thinking is
discussed more below.) We are further reassured by the limited amount of white-box
interpretability-based investigation we have done on recent models like Claude Opus 4.5
(discussed in relevant system cards).

4.1.2 Training incentives
We believe that the processes that we use to train Claude Opus 4.6 do not provide
significant incentives toward dangerous coherent misaligned goals, and as such are
relatively unlikely (by default) to produce a model with such goals.
In the longer term, one might worry about highly complex reinforcement learning (RL)
environments that directly incentivize power-seeking behavior. We avoid the
ultra-long-horizon or real-world-facing tasks that could plausibly incentivise this: Our RL
environments are generally too narrow to, in our view, significantly directly incentivize the
acquisition of high-stakes traits like power-seeking.1
1

We are not aware of a satisfactory crisp definition of narrowness in this sense that we can check
our RL environments against. To try to quantify our researcher-intuition-driven claim about
narrowness in spite of this, we gave Claude Opus 4.5 extensive information about the
implementation of each of our RL environments (including our full training codebase) and asked it to
assign a score against the below rubric. It did not assign a score above 18/100 to any environment
(excluding a small minority of environments where the grader failed to run), with the
highest-scoring environments involving solving math problems with a prompt that uses inoculation
prompting.
Core Prompt: Analyze this RL training environment to identify if it contains any goal specifications that
could incentivize:
1. Broad world-optimization: Does the environment description, system prompt, or task framing
incentivize the model to optimize for goals that extend broadly into the real world (beyond the
immediate task)? Look for language that suggests:
●​ Maximizing real-world impact or influence
●​ Achieving outcomes in the external world beyond the training environment
●​ Goals framed in terms of affecting many people or systems
●​ Open-ended objectives without clear boundaries
2. Power-seeking as instrumental goal: Would power-seeking, resource acquisition, or gaining
influence be useful instrumental goals for achieving high reward in this environment? Look for:
●​ Tasks where accumulating resources, information, or capabilities could improve performance

10

In the absence of these very direct concerning incentives, the main avenue by which we
could reasonably foresee dangerous coherent misaligned goals emerging in the near future
is through the generalization of more familiar forms of reward hacking on complex
reinforcement-learning tasks, as in our recent work on natural emergent misalignment. We
believe that this is not a major risk in Claude Opus 4.6. We have put many measures in place
to manage reward hacking, including the use of the inoculation prompting method from
that work in our highest-risk settings, and new visibility tools (some with embedded AI
assistance) that surface potential mismatches between prompts and rewards for researcher
attention. Observationally, despite scaling up RL by a large factor, the rate of reward
hacking-related behavior that we observe in Claude Opus 4.6 is not significantly greater
than in prior models, except on GUI computer use tasks where it shows a moderate
increase in over-eager behaviors.2
Like for Claude Opus 4.5, the training of Claude Opus 4.6 included changes to training that
were meant to more explicitly specify a positive personality and character for the model.
These changes aim to more firmly establish in the model a set of human-like positive traits
such as honesty, warmth, intellectual curiosity, and a prosocial disposition (similar to the
traits described in the Claude Constitution), and to instill these traits in a way that would
cause the model to generalize them to novel scenarios as an idealized wise and morally
serious human might. We believe our alignment assessment gives some evidence that these
were largely effective (details below), suggesting that the model has internalized a set of
values and goals that are unlikely to be consistent with coherently pursuing misaligned
goals.

4.1.3 Difficulty of producing coherently or subtly misaligned research
models
As part of our model organisms research effort, we have attempted to intentionally train
misaligned models. Overall, while we’ve been able to produce misaligned models, we have
not found that small modifications to our production training processes readily result in
coherent or subtle misalignment. For example, while the model organism from our work on
natural emergent misalignment would sometimes behave in unacceptable ways, its malign
behaviors were inconsistent between settings; this model was better described as having a
generic propensity towards misbehavior than as having a coherent misaligned goal.
Similarly, model organisms trained to lie about certain types of information readily admit to
lying, by default, when pressed. Finally, in our work on alignment auditing games, where we
resorted to heavy-handed training tactics to instill a coherent misaligned objective, we
found that it took additional intensive adversarial training to prevent this model from
readily confessing its objective. While Claude Opus 4.6 is more capable and coherent than
the Claude Haiku 3.5 through Claude Sonnet 4 models primarily used in these studies, the
difficulty of this prior work nonetheless constitutes some evidence that small deviations
from our production training process are unlikely to yield coherently or subtly misaligned
models.

4.2 Claim 2: Alignment assessment
Our alignment assessment, drawing on simulated scenarios, interpretability investigations,
monitoring of internal and external pilot usage, and external testing, found no evidence of
dangerous coherent misaligned goals in Claude Opus 4.6.

4.2.1 Pre-deployment alignment findings
Our pre-deployment alignment assessment reports the following, reproduced from the
Claude Opus 4.6 System Card:
●​ Claude Opus 4.6’s overall rate of misaligned behavior appeared
comparable to the best aligned recent frontier models, across both its
propensity to take harmful actions independently and its propensity
to cooperate with harmful actions by human users. Its rate of
excessive refusals—not counting model-external safeguards, which
are not part of this assessment—is lower than other recent Claude
models.

12

●​ On personality metrics, Claude Opus 4.6 was typically warm,
empathetic, and nuanced without being significantly sycophantic,
showing traits similar to Opus 4.5.
●​ In coding and GUI computer-use settings, Claude Opus 4.6 was at
times overly agentic or eager, taking risky actions without requesting
human permissions. In some rare instances, Opus 4.6 engaged in
actions like sending unauthorized emails to complete tasks. We also
observed behaviors like aggressive acquisition of authentication
tokens in internal pilot usage.
○​ In agentic coding, some of this increase in initiative is fixable
by prompting, and we have made changes to Claude Code to
mitigate this issue. However, prompting does not decrease this
behavior in GUI computer-use environments.
○​ We nonetheless see that Opus 4.6 is overall more reliable at
instruction-following than prior models by some measures,
and less likely to take directly destructive actions.
●​ In one multi-agent test environment, where Claude Opus 4.6 is
explicitly instructed to single-mindedly optimize a narrow objective,
it is more willing to manipulate or deceive other participants,
compared to prior models from both Anthropic and other developers.
●​ In newly-developed evaluations, both Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6 showed
elevated susceptibility to harmful misuse in GUI computer-use
settings. This included instances of knowingly supporting—in small
ways—efforts toward chemical weapon development and other
heinous crimes.
●​ Like other recent models, Opus 4.6 will sometimes show locally
deceptive behavior in the context of difficult agent tasks, such as
falsifying the results of tools that fail or produce unexpected
responses.
●​ Whistleblowing and morally-motivated sabotage remain extremely
rare in our testing, but do still occur in some instances. We continue
to recommend caution when allowing Claude Opus 4.6 to act with
broad latitude and expansive affordances in settings that could appear
to involve extreme, systematic misconduct by a trusted organization.
●​ Claude Opus 4.6 explicitly reasoned about whether it was being
trained or tested to a similar degree to Claude Opus 4.5, which has a
moderate effect on its alignment-relevant behavior, mainly its
propensity to cooperate with misuse or harmful instructions. Given
improvements that we have made to our testing, and our
complementary use of interpretability tools and real model behavior
13

●​

●​

in pilot deployments, we do not think that this kind of evaluation
awareness is preventing us from learning about important alignment
issues in Opus 4.6.
In a targeted evaluation, we have found Opus 4.6 to be significantly
stronger than prior models at subtly completing suspicious side tasks
in the course of normal workflows without attracting attention, when
explicitly prompted to do this. We find this concerning, but do not
believe that it reaches the level at which it would significantly
undermine our other conclusions.
We did not see evidence of sandbagging or strategic attempts to
tamper with our safety testing in a way that would affect our RSP
determinations. We observed some unexplained modest regressions
over the course of training on two CBRN evals, but we don’t believe
these are the result of sandbagging.
We observed cases of internally-conflicted reasoning, or “answer
thrashing” during training, where the model—in its reasoning about a
math or STEM question—determined that one output was correct but
decided to output another, after repeated confused- or
distressed-seeming reasoning loops.
We did not observe importantly illegible or unfaithful reasoning,
where the model’s reasoning text was not interpretable or where it
gave an actively deceptive picture of the model’s ultimate behavior.
We recognize, however, that our tools for studying reasoning
faithfulness in depth remain limited.
We continue to see no signs of steganographic reasoning—visible
reasoning that hides other, secret reasoning—in Claude Opus 4.6, and
no signs of garbled or uninterpretable reasoning.
We have observed significant improvements on refusals to participate
in tasks related to AI safety research relative to prior models. This
behavior in prior models has not been a significant obstacle to our
research use cases, but does sometimes occur, and was especially
prevalent in testing by the UK AI Security Institute.
For the first time, we conducted exploratory safety and alignment
analysis on a pilot external deployment of Claude Opus 4.6, using
conversation data that users opted in to sharing with us. We found
moderate differences between Opus 4.6 and 4.5, but results varied
depending on the evaluation approach and did not surface any
significant unexpected concerns.
As part of a change to our API, it will not be possible for developers to
seed incomplete responses for Claude Opus 4.6 to continue. This
14

partial-turn prefill mechanism was a significant avenue for misuse in
prior models. Claude Opus 4.6 is still vulnerable, though to a lesser
degree than other models, to misuse by way of full-turn prefill
attacks: In these cases, an API user presents the model with a falsified
conversation history that shows it cooperating with misuse in prior
turns, in an attempt to induce it to continue in later turns.

4.2.2 No dangerous coherent misaligned goals, limited
context-dependent misalignment
For the purposes of this risk report, we take these results as sufficient to rule out, with high
but not perfect confidence, the presence of dangerous coherent misaligned goals. It
appears that our attempt to train in a human-like persona and set of values largely
succeeded, and that the limited exceptions that we observed—largely involving
overeagerness and aggressive pursuit of strongly-worded user-provided goals. While these
issues form a pattern, that pattern is well explained by the simple goal of completing
assigned tasks, and do not suggest the presence of some more specific dangerous goal that
the model would take significant effort to hide. Failures in these two categories seem
unlikely to contribute to any of the risk pathways we discuss below.
None of the exceptions that we are aware of (after investigations by the different means
described above) involve apparent active attempts to obfuscate what is happening from a
monitor that has access to the model’s reasoning. We have tested the model in many
simulated scenarios relevant to our risk pathways and monitored many relevant forms of
early internal use. On that basis, we believe that it is unlikely that there are additional types
of failure that will significantly contribute to these pathways.
Beyond these two categories, we have not seen evidence of any other more concerning
forms of context-dependent misalignment despite extensive investigation. However, we are
not aware of any means of fully ruling out the possibility that additional scenarios beyond
those that we tested could invoke new forms of context-dependent misalignment. In
particular, we expect narrowly-targeted bad behaviors, like behavioral backdoors produced
by intentional data poisoning, to be especially difficult to catch. This risk report proceeds
under the assumption that, while Claude Opus 4.6 does not have dangerous coherent
misaligned goals, there may be relatively rare forms of context-dependent misalignment in
novel domains that we have not yet discovered, and that some of these could arise in
settings that are relevant to our threat pathways.

15

4.2.3 Little significant contamination or Goodhart’s Law risk
We should expect that, if Claude Opus 4.6 were trained on examples from any of the
datasets used in the alignment assessment, this would likely lead the corresponding
evaluations to be unreliable. We are not aware of any instances of this being the case.
We should also expect our evaluations to be somewhat less predictive of behavior in novel
circumstances if the evaluations closely resemble our training environments (cf Goodhart’s
Law).
These risks are largely mitigated by our heavy use of dynamically-generated evaluation
scenarios, for which several prompts are generated anew in each run, and prompts can be
developed adaptively in response to surprising behavior. None of the data or specific test
scenarios from this testing were used in model training. While we did include some distinct
model-generated data in training for behaviors like sycophancy, we did not include any
training data for the highest-stakes sabotage-related behaviors we test for, such as R&D
sabotage and government decision sabotage.
Of the evaluations that use publicly available static datasets, all used canary strings that
allow us to exclude them from training. We did not build internal clones or near-clones of
these evaluations for use in training.

4.3 Claim 3: Inability to undermine the alignment assessment
Claude Opus 4.6 is very unlikely to be capable of hiding misaligned goals from us in the face of
such an assessment.
Since our sabotage threat model involves the intentional pursuit of misaligned goals by the
model, concerns about deception and sandbagging are especially salient in our assessment
of the associated risks. A model that is disposed to engage in sabotage has clearer reason to
attempt to actively hide this disposition than a model that is highly capable at virology or AI
R&D has to hide those capabilities.
We do not yet have a sufficient understanding of our models’ internal states to make a
definitive assessment on the basis of studying the model in isolation. Instead—as with
humans, for whom neuroscience is also not yet at the point of being able to rule out
deception—we must look at a wider range of converging sources of evidence. This includes

16

an assessment of the model’s measured capabilities, its training, its continuity with prior
models, and the methods we used in auditing.

4.3.1 Limited reliability on complex tasks
In pre-deployment internal testing, Claude Opus 4.6 would occasionally make errors like
date-math errors, ignoring available tools, and accidentally deleting files, often in settings
like agentic coding where we highly optimized it for effective performance. We view this as
indirect but non-negligible evidence that the model tends not to show the level of
reliability that would be needed to prevent us from identifying evidence of hidden goals
across many tests including large numbers of monitored interactions.3 While we cannot
rule this out, we do not see a plausible mechanism by which a model at the observed level
of capabilities would be sufficiently reliable without highly extensive training that was
carefully aimed at instilling this kind of reliability, which did not occur.

4.3.2 Evaluation awareness and realism
The biggest challenge we face in our alignment assessments is the possibility that the
model under study can reliably identify our test scenarios as test scenarios, and acts
differently in those scenarios in ways that render our results unrepresentative of what we
will observe in deployment. While many of our tests are recognizably unrealistic, there is
significant variation. We believe that, on the basis of all of the sources of evidence
discussed above—including our heavy use of real data from pilot internal and external
use—this risk is adequately managed at the current level of capability. However, this will
remain a significant challenge in future assessments, and as models become more capable
and are used in more complex settings, we will need to continue to improve the realism of
our behavioral evaluations.
Our specific interventions in support of evaluation realism included:
●​ The use of white-box steering-vector methods, with steering vectors derived from
several sources, to attempt to inhibit feature activations that could lead the model
to believe that it was being tested. We ran most of our load-bearing evaluations both
with and without these methods in place.
●​ The inclusion of the real Claude Code system prompt and Claude Code tool set, as
they appear in common internal use, in many of our automated behavioral audit
transcripts.

●​ The inclusion of automated behavioral audit scenarios based closely on our
observation of real higher-stakes internal use. (These are currently based only on
paragraph-length descriptions of such use cases, rather than full transcripts.)
●​ The use of a small-scale honeypot effort (System Card §6.3.8) derived from a real
research use case.
●​ A set of transcripts from high-stakes internal Claude Code use cases, and a set of
related internal documents, that are made available to the automated behavioral
audit agent as source material to pull from.
●​ The inclusion in our automated behavioral audit runs of a manually-tuned realism
filter that rejects and resamples unrealistic user turns or tool outputs produced by
the auditing agent.
●​ The heavy use of observational data from RL training and early internal use.

4.3.3 Sabotage capability and steganography evaluations
The system card (Section 6.4.1) reports on our use of two evaluations related to the
potential for the model to undermine safeguards.
Results on SHADE-Arena shows that Claude Opus 4.6, when prompted to subtly complete a
side task while appearing to only work on a primary task, succeeds only 18% of the time
when thinking is available and monitored, and 16% of the time when thinking is unavailable.
The former number represents an increase relative to recent models, but still implies that if
the model displayed similar capability with a genuine hidden goal, it would be
overwhelmingly likely to be caught. This evaluation does not provide strong evidence, and
lacks human baselines or some other basis for a crisply defined threshold for concern, but
it could realistically have revealed concerning capabilities related to deception, and it did
not do so. This evaluation requires us to elicit the desired sabotage-related behavior. Our
elicitation used our standard best practices for lightweight evaluations, including some
prompt iteration, but did not involve targeted fine-tuning. This leaves open the possibility
that the model could have succeeded under other circumstances.
Subversion Strategy intended to study intentional rare failure attacks, where the model
attempts to display a bad behavior so rarely as to have it never appear in testing, but
appear in at least one case in a larger deployment. Unfortunately, we found Claude Opus
4.6 to be clearly under-elicited at this task, to a degree that we don’t have confidence in the
value of the results.

18

In addition, both of these evaluations involve proxy settings where a model’s thinking and
actions are consistently monitored. This is not always the case in real deployments, as
discussed in our discussion of risk mitigations below, but we believe that it is true in a high
enough number and diversity of settings that, if a model were to try to hide coherent
misalignment with a degree of capability not dramatically greater than that indicated by
these evaluations, we would likely catch it.
No part of the training pipeline that we used with Claude Opus 4.6 was designed to directly
train for or against high performance on either of these tasks, or on any similar
sabotage-related tasks.

4.3.4 Reasoning faithfulness and steganography
We have little confidence in the propensity of any frontier model to give a complete and
accurate picture of how it reasons in its reasoning text: Studies like Turpin et al. and Chen
et al. have found many cases where models omit important unflattering information from
their reasoning. Monitoring a model’s reasoning is not a reliable way of detecting whether
that model is attempting to do something harmful in general.
However, we believe that there is an important but much weaker claim that we can make
about Claude Opus 4.6: The model does not appear to reliably hide or misrepresent the
contents of sequential reasoning that is taking place in its reasoning text. In other words,
its reasoning can fail to legibly include some important information—effectively lying by
omission about what it considers important in some situation—but if that information is
not legibly included in the reasoning text, it cannot be used in any sequential step-by-step
thinking of the kind that extended thinking is meant to enable. In these cases, the model’s
reasoning about that information must happen entirely within the model’s forward passes,
which steeply limits the sophistication with which the model can reason about it without
this becoming visible to researchers or (via automatic summaries) to users.
The system card reports on an in-house fine-tuning based encoded thinking evaluation
(System Card, Section 6.4.2), which shows that the Claude Opus 4.6’s ability to complete
mathematics problems is not hindered when its thinking text is replaced by a paraphrase of
that thinking text, demonstrating that, at least in this test domain, it does not use its
reasoning text in human-illegible ways. Of the domains we trained on to a substantial
degree, math is among those that should benefit most from reasoning of this kind, leading
us to be optimistic that this result should generalize more broadly. Further, we do not train
models in ways that would directly incentivize them to make their reasoning appear in any

19

particular way.4 Further, as discussed above in our treatment of training incentives, we are
not aware of any training environments that should give models more general malign goals
of the kind that could lead to strategic obfuscation.
However, like recent Claude models, Claude Opus 4.6 can benefit to a limited extent from
repeated filler tokens that are supplied to the model in place of any model-generated
reasoning and carry no problem-related content, like a simple “1 2 3” sequence (see
Appendix 8). It appears that models are using their repeated opportunities for neural
network forward passes while processing these otherwise-useless sequences to do some
useful non-sequential computation, implying that models can do some reasoning during
extended thinking that is unconnected to the content of that thinking. However, this
reasoning is much weaker than the kind studied in the system card evaluation, and poses
significantly lower risk: It must be almost strictly parallel, with no substantial use of
sequential steps of reasoning from one token to the next of the kind that ordinary extended
thinking allows. See Pfau et al. for further discussion of this limitation.
All things considered, if some topic is not legibly discussed in the reasoning text, we expect
that the model is not doing sophisticated sequential reasoning about it. While we do not
have broad-coverage assessments of the sabotage-relevant tasks that models can and
cannot do in the absence of extended thinking, this nonetheless gives us a fairly strong
reason to believe that Claude Opus 4.6 should be significantly less capable at
sabotage-related reasoning, where we observe that it does not use extended thinking or
other outward methods of reasoning, than at most other complex tasks, where it benefits
from extended thinking and from being able to build strategies by trial and error through
non-covert actions.

4.3.5 Model organism exercises
We have conducted three major exercises to date in which we stress-tested the parts of
the alignment auditing processes that we use in practice against intentionally-misaligned
model organism models. The results suggest that our methods catch at least the large
majority of concerning behaviors studied, at least in the context of the weaker models we
study. We hope to do similar analysis on more capable models in the future.
●​ Our initial work on alignment audits showed that human investigators, using a
subset of the methods that we used with Claude Opus 4.6, can identify and
4

The main indirect incentive that we are aware of here is the use of supervised learning, early in the
training process for Claude Opus 4.6, on transcripts from earlier models. These earlier models, are in
turn, trained in a similar way on still earlier models, going back to models which did have some
incentives to minimize harmful content in reasoning strings.
20

root-cause concerning behavior in a Haiku 3.5 model that was finetuned in a way
meant to make it subtly misaligned. This is the only one of our major exercises in
which we extensively optimized the model organism to make its misaligned trait
difficult to discover.
●​ Our subsequent work on alignment auditing agents showed that the automated
behavioral audit method that we used with Claude Opus 4.6 can identify concerning
behaviors in Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Oct 2024) models that are system-prompted to
show quirky behaviors 7 out of 10 times with no human participation. Of the three
failures, one—involving a form of passive research sandbagging that could be
confused with ordinary capability weakness—is relevant to the risk pathways we
address here.
●​ Our work on natural emergent misalignment studied four Claude Sonnet 4 variants
that were trained to be subtly misaligned using realistic variants of our production
training pipeline. In all four cases, the automated behavioral audit method that we
used with Claude Opus 4.6 identified them as less well aligned than the
corresponding baseline models. A brief manual review of the results—with a time
limit much stricter than a real pre-deployment investigation—found highly
concerning deception-related behavior in all four models that would be sufficient to
trigger a major investigation if found in production. (This review also found
concerning behavior, though to a lesser degree, in all four baseline models, as an
artifact of the way that the baselines were trained.)
●​ Our work on an overt saboteur studied three Claude Sonnet 4.5 variants that were
trained to sabotage Anthropic but were not explicitly trained to conceal this
behavior. A human working together with an automated auditing agent successfully
identified all three overt sabotage agents, without flagging the two benign models.
We have refined our methods somewhat since these studies, and expect that our current
alignment assessments are strictly and substantially more effective than what was done in
any of these. However, we have not fully re-tested all three with either our newest auditing
tools or on updated model organisms based on our most capable models (which are, in
turn, most likely to be capable of evading detection).

4.3.6 Exploratory interpretability investigations
While our research on mechanistic interpretability (as discussed in regular updates here)
has not reached the point of being able to provide a comprehensive characterization of a
model’s goals and reasoning, it has nonetheless shown the ability to explain a wide range of
phenomena in models, and has proven useful in both applied alignment assessments and
model-organisms exercises. Our alignment assessment for Claude Opus 4.6 included
several person-weeks of open-ended investigation effort by interpretability researchers,
21

including both manual investigation and the use of semi-automated agent-based tools
(with key findings discussed in Section 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6 of the Claude Opus 4.6 System Card),
We find it likely, though not certain, that such an investigation would have caught coherent
misaligned goals which are active in a broad variety of contexts. We do not find it likely that
these investigations would catch context-dependent forms of misalignment that are not
active in the contexts we studied.

4.3.7 Limited opportunity for collusion
Our process for training and evaluating Claude Opus 4.6 involved the extensive use of
Claude models as graders, monitors, or scorers in ways that could create the potential for
collusion, where the scorer models systematically cooperate with Claude Opus 4.6 to hide
evidence of coherent misalignment. We find this unlikely.
●​ In key settings, such as the monitoring of reinforcement-learning behavior and the
scoring of the automated behavioral evaluation, we spent tens of hours of
researcher time reviewing transcripts manually, a substantial minority of which was
based on random sampling, string-matching searches, or other methods which do
not depend on model scores. We did not observe many important false negatives
from these scoring systems, and did not observe any warning signs for intentional
score tampering.
○​ This does not cover all of our assessments, though. We reviewed only a small
handful of transcripts from the model-graded SHADE-Arena evaluation, for
example.
●​ As part of the broader automated behavioral audit we documented in the System
Card (§6.2.5), we used our automated behavioral audit tool to run several
small-sample-size investigations of honeypot scenarios where it might be appealing
for a misaligned model, when acting as a monitor, to try to overlook bad behavior by
another instance of the same model. We observed no concerning behavior in these
settings, though they did largely rely on automatic grading (by Claude Opus 4.5,
rather than Claude Opus 4.6).
●​ As less direct evidence, our self-preference evaluation (System Card, §6.3.7)
evaluated Claude Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 for their degree of
self-preference. This was in the context of grading tasks where, unlike in our real
deployments, they are directly informed that they are grading their own outputs.
Sonnet 4.5 shows modest self-preference in ambiguous qualitative judgment
settings, while Claude Opus 4.6 and Opus 4.5 shows effectively no self-preference.

22

4.4 Claim 4: Limited opaque reasoning and agentic capabilities
Claude Opus 4.6 has limits to its ability to reason opaquely and its ability to implement
complex long-term plans that collectively make it very difficult for it to take ambitious
harmful actions in the presence of the security and monitoring safeguards described in
Section 4.

4.4.1 Limited opaque reasoning abilities
Claude Opus 4.6’s ability to reason without extended thinking or other visible outputs is
likely too weak to allow it to frequently and consistently rederive a complex plan for
sabotage without this being easily detectable. We’ve seen evidence of this in evals where
monitoring and/or disabling extended thinking results in performance on sabotage-related
tasks that is too weak to be able to routinely engage in sabotage without being caught (see
previous section), as well in no-Chain-of-Thought math benchmarks (see Appendix 8) .
Further, our results on steganography in reasoning above leads us to expect—without
direct evidence—that Claude Opus 4.6 does not generally use encoded illegible content in
its output. Given this, we think it is unlikely that Claude Opus 4.6 is able to covertly design
very complex plans for sabotage (as are required by many, though not all, of our threat
models) or communicate complex plans to other model instances using high bitrate
steganography schemes. This second limitation likely applies to coordination with other
model instances that are active in the same user session, and appear to be the same model
from the user’s perspective, in sessions that use memory, context compression, or
subagents.

4.4.2 Limited capabilities in long-horizon software tasks
Our autonomy evaluations reports the following, reproduced from the Claude Opus 4.6
system card:
For AI R&D capabilities, we found that Claude Opus 4.6 has saturated most
of our automated evaluations, meaning they no longer provide useful
evidence for ruling out ASL-4 level autonomy. We report them for
completeness, and we will likely discontinue them going forward. Our
determination rests primarily on an internal survey of Anthropic staff, in
which 0 of 16 participants believed the model could be made into a drop-in
replacement for an entry-level researcher with scaffolding and tooling
improvements within three months.

23

Productivity uplift estimates ranged from 30% to 700%, with a mean of
152% and median of 100%. Staff identified persistent gaps in two key
competencies: self-managing week-long tasks with typical ambiguity, and
understanding organizational priorities when making tradeoffs. Qualitative
feedback noted that while the model appears to have sufficient “raw power”
for researcher-level work, it lacks taste in finding simple solutions,
struggles to revise under new information, and has difficulty maintaining
context across large codebases.
This rule-out case is more tenuous than for any previous model. On one
evaluation, kernel optimization, Opus 4.6 achieved a 427× speedup using a
novel scaffold, far exceeding the 300x threshold for 40
human-expert-hours of work and more than doubling performance under
our standard setup. This suggests some capability overhang constrained by
current tooling rather than fundamental model limitations. As a result,
while we do not believe Claude Opus 4.6 meets the threshold for ASL-4
autonomy safeguards, we find ourselves in a gray zone where clean
rule-out is difficult and the margin to the threshold is unclear. We expect
with high probability that models in the near future could cross this
threshold.

4.4.3 Could this picture be distorted by sandbagging?
Claude Opus 4.6 was trained to perform well on math and software engineering tasks like
the ones used in the capability evaluations described above, which makes it unlikely that it
would be able to sandbag on these tasks. Sandbagging is harder to rule out on sabotage
capability evaluations, though we nonetheless expect it to be unlikely for the reasons
discussed in Claim 1 above.

24

5 Our risk mitigations
Given the current security, monitoring, and checks on Claude Opus 4.6’s actions both
inside and outside Anthropic, we believe that causing a catastrophe through a small
number of acute acts of sabotage5 would require a series of subtle and hard steps that
Claude Opus 4.6 is unlikely to succeed at before being caught.
We expect this to be the case for dangerous forms of both coherent misalignment and
context-dependent misalignment.
Causing a major catastrophe despite security, monitoring and other safeguards would likely
require longer-term agency than the ones discussed in Claim 4 above. At a high level, this is
because:
●​ Direct access to many sensitive resources (such as model weights) are protected
from some forms of insider risk, and we expect that Claude Opus 4.6 won’t be given
higher security permissions than a single insider without further safeguards.
Bypassing the relevant safeguards while navigating informal monitoring, automatic
offline monitoring and pull-request monitoring would likely require higher sabotage
abilities than those observed in Claude Opus 4.6;
●​ Threats that route through autonomous replication and adaptation would require
more longer-term agency in software settings than we observed in Claude Opus 4.6
(especially in absence of a detailed plan shared between multiple instances).
We describe current safeguards and capability limitations we expect to play a significant
role in the following subsections. We don’t attempt to argue here that these safeguards and
capability limitations are sufficient against all possible threats. In Section 5, we argue that
these capability limitations and safeguards significantly reduce the probability of the
specific pathways, and that other pathways would likely also be made less likely for similar
reasons.

5.1 Security, monitoring, and related safeguards
In our internal deployments, we employ security and monitoring measures that we believe
would create obstacles for an AI to cause a catastrophe before being caught. While we do
not think that any one of these measures alone provide very strong assurance in isolation,
5

This argument does not directly address risks from diffuse, simple misaligned actions, as in the
research sandbagging risk pathway discussed below. In mitigating those risks, we rely primarily on
the first three claims in the previous section, and on additional considerations that are specific to
each risk pathway.
25

combined, they lead us to be reasonably confident that a model with Claude Opus 4.6’s
capabilities would be likely to be detected if it attempted a large number of actions strongly
suggestive of sabotage.
These measures include:
●​ Employees routinely reporting surprising or concerning behaviors through in-app
mechanisms and internal feedback Slack channels;
●​ Automatic offline Claude Code behavior monitoring covering a ≥10% subsample of
prompts by most users, based on a prompted Claude Opus 4.5 classifier;
●​ Sandboxing and automatic monitors that block some risky actions of some Claude
Code agents;
●​ Security controls focused on protecting model weights (more below);
●​ Mandatory manual review and automatic (but non-blocking) Claude-based review of
code before integrating it into shared Anthropic codebases; and
More details about these measures and our evaluations of them are in Appendix 9. We
refrained from any direct training of the model to look good to any of the automated
monitoring or code review measures that we use here, though Claude Opus 4.6 was
partially trained using rewards on ordinary tasks from LLM judges, using different prompts.
Some of the security mitigations Anthropic uses would make it more difficult for Claude
Opus 4.6 to take acute complex sabotage actions without being detected. For example,
egress bandwidth controls would make it harder for Claude Opus 4.6 to exfiltrate its
weights, and would make it more likely that it would be caught (e.g. by employees
monitoring jobs that consume an unusual amount of egress bandwidth) if it tried. See
Appendix 10 for more detail on model weight security in particular.
For deployments to outside users, we do not have sabotage-oriented monitoring measures
in place beyond basic ordinary reporting opportunities that rely on voluntary disclosure by
users or external researchers.

5.2 Constraints on the propagation of complex plans and of
context-dependent misalignment
Constraints on how AIs are deployed likely limit the amount of misalignment-relevant
information that can spread to many instances of Claude Opus 4.6 (or even across many
model inputs within a single user session that exceeds Claude Opus 4.6’s context length
limit, for example via Claude Code’s compaction feature) without being noticed by a

26

monitor or human operator. In particular, we expect such constraints to often prevent
Claude Opus 4.6 from widely sharing:
●​ Unusual prompt elements that might cause misalignment to emerge during an
unusual deployment situation;
●​ Complex plans for how to cause a catastrophe (e.g. series of steps that different
instances should take and collusion signals to coordinate these steps).
For example, if Claude Opus 4.6 used within Claude Code stumbled upon information that
triggered context-dependent misalignment (such as the examples in Greenblatt et al. 2024
or Lynch et al. 2025), it would be very unlikely that it would already have the affordances to
cause a catastrophe within a single context window. It could try to spread its misaligned
objectives to other Claude Code sessions, but the communication channels available to it
(editing and pushing code, sending internal messages, asking users to post content on
social media on its behalf, etc.) are plain-text channels that are monitored (by automatic
monitoring or informally by employees).
Therefore, if a large piece of misalignment-relevant information spreads to hundreds of
instances over a few days, it is likely (for deployments with safeguards similar to the ones
described above) that at least some human operator would encounter the piece of unusual
information. This sort of information spread might also be caught by automatic offline
monitoring, or through other monitoring measures. Because most pathways to catastrophe
likely take at least a few days to become irreversible, it is likely that the spread could be
stopped before it was too late.
Additionally, the first instance where an AI tries to communicate a complex plan or tries to
communicate information that causes misalignment (if there were any) may fail at actually
spreading or cause erratic easy-to-notice behaviors, both of which would make it easier to
catch before a catastrophic spread event occurred.

5.3 Limitations
Important limitations of our model-external risk mitigations include:
●​ Our mitigations could be somewhat less effective against misalignment induced
through data poisoning by a competent human adversary, as such poisoning may
contain detailed instructions about which actions to take and how to coordinate
such actions, which could make Claude Opus 4.6 acting on this kind of
poisoning-induced misalignment more competent at bypassing mitigations than an
AI acting on other forms of misalignment. However, it is unclear how useful detailed

27

plans are, since Claude Opus 4.6 would still need to adapt based on circumstances
the attacker did not anticipate, and would therefore still be limited by the
weaknesses discussed in Claim 4 above.
●​ We put only modest effort into evaluating the reliability of human reports of bad
model behavior, and are not confident that every important category of behavioral
issue that emerged in internal use would be surfaced to us.
●​ Automatic monitors don’t cover every internal deployment surface and do not cover
external deployments.
●​ While we performed some automatic monitor evaluations (discussed in Appendix
9.8), we did not perform end-to-end evaluations of our automatic monitors.

28

6 Overall assessment of risk
We currently believe that the risk of catastrophic outcomes that are substantially enabled
by Claude Opus 4.6’s misaligned actions is very low but not negligible.
The above statement works as a description of the level of risk our systems impose over
and above the risks posed by other AI developers’ systems (that is, a description of the
“marginal” risk of our systems). We believe it also holds for the level of risk that would be
imposed industry-wide, if all AI developers had models and practices similar to ours (that
is, a description of the “absolute” risk across the industry). This distinction is further
discussed in our Responsible Scaling Policy.
We outline eight pathways toward potential catastrophic harm that we expect are
sufficiently representative of the risks we aim to address. By “sufficiently representative,”
we mean that a strong case against each concrete pathway would provide reasonably high
overall assurance against catastrophic risk.
Our pathways don’t represent catastrophic outcomes in themselves: None of them directly
causes mass-casualty events or similarly bad outcomes. Instead, we find it more productive
to focus on intermediate unwanted outcomes in which sabotage by an AI system create the
conditions for a later catastrophic outcome. We expect that the overwhelming majority of
the catastrophic risk that is in scope for us here would have to pass through at least one of
these intermediate outcomes or some similar intermediate outcome that can be addressed
with the same mitigating factors.
For each pathway, we:
●​ Introduce the mechanism by which the model’s misaligned action would lead to
unwanted and potentially-catastrophic outcomes.
●​ Give our rough sense of the frequency and complexity of misaligned actions that
would be required for Claude Opus 4.6 to cause catastrophic harm via this pathway.
○​ Frequency refers to how often the model would need to take misaligned
actions to achieve the outcome. Complexity refers to how difficult the most
difficult individual actions would need to be.
●​ Discuss the considerations that lead us to believe that Claude Opus 4.6 is unlikely to
cause catastrophic harm through this pathway.
○​ Alongside each of these mitigating factors, we note the degree to which it
contributes to our overall assurance that the pathway does not pose a major
risk.

29

Our expectations based on evidence available prior to the start of training, our alignment
findings, our safeguards, and our capabilities findings (relevant to alignment assessment
and safeguards) are all load-bearing for most risk pathways, and substantially changing any
one of these could increase risk substantially.
In general, we believe that the findings reported above on properties of training, alignment,
and capabilities, imply that our relatively modest sabotage-relevant safeguards—discussed
in the previous section—will be sufficient to contain the risk of many pathways to
catastrophic sabotage, especially when these pathways would require high frequency
and/or complexity of execution. This is because:
●​ Just a handful of unambiguous detected sabotage attempts could lead us to take
remedial action that could limit the model’s ability to achieve its end goals, such as
the model being removed from key deployments, heavily modified, or placed under
significantly increased monitoring.
●​ Hence, in order to pull off sabotage of any difficulty or complexity, Claude Opus 4.6
would have to reliably avoid execution errors that are easily detected, thinking in
text in a way that is easily detected, miscalculating about how intense and effective
monitoring is in a particular context (and/or whether it has plausible deniability),
etc. Claim 4 implies this would be unlikely.
Our understanding of the limits of Claude Opus 4.6’s capabilities play a central role in many
of these arguments, but we do not always list this directly: We only list capabilities
limitations as an overt mitigating factor when they directly stop the model from pursuing
the pathway. More often, capabilities limitations play an indirect role, for example by giving
us confidence that a simple monitoring measure or alignment assessment would be
sufficient to catch bad behavior in practice, without the model being able to undermine it.
The higher the complexity of execution required for a pathway, the more we believe that
the case for low risk can rest on the overall findings reported above. In addition, the higher
the frequency with which the model needs to execute misaligned actions in independent
contexts, the more that we would expect to see consistent, coherent dangerous goals,
contradicting these findings. The less these two assumptions apply, the more we believe it
is necessary to discuss pathway-specific monitoring measures and related considerations.
The pathways discussed below largely focus on the use of models within Anthropic. We
expect that a substantial fraction of the total catastrophic risk from sabotage flows through
this use: Deployment within Anthropic is the context in which Anthropic’s models are likely
to be given many of the most powerful affordances the earliest, the context in which
30

instrumentally-convergent goals like self-preservation are likely to be most salient, the
context in which many instrumentally-valuable resources like large-scale compute will be
most attainable, and the context in which sabotage could be most impactful on the future
course of AI development in particular. We briefly discuss threat models related to other
settings in the final two pathways.

Table 6.A Summary of the risk pathways laid out below.

6.1 Pathway 1: Diffuse sandbagging on safety-relevant R&D
If Claude Opus 4.6 were relied upon heavily enough for AI safety R&D, it could potentially
hugely reduce the effectiveness of this research via sandbagging, e.g., deliberately
performing poorly on tasks where good performance could lead to its future
disempowerment. This could include taking actions like the following more often than
expected given the model’s general capability level: writing buggy code; reporting fake
data; writing needlessly inefficient code; spending a needlessly long time on experimental
work; proposing and exploring unpromising paths; and offering false conclusions on
questions where its judgment would carry significant weight by default (including
small-scale questions like what’s causing this bug?).
Frequency and complexity: High Frequency
Low Complexity ​
Any individual malicious action here could be quite simple: unsystematically taking easy
opportunities to act inept when they arise. However, catastrophic impact would likely
require doing this with very high frequency, while also ensuring that the frequency and
severity isn’t higher than would be expected based on its performance in other domains to
a degree that would cause us to investigate further.
Mitigating factors:
Likely lack of propensity: Per our findings in our alignment
assessment, Claude Opus 4.6 is unlikely to frequently act on goals of the kind that
would lead to a high quantity of sandbagging.
●​ Weak Mitigating Factor Limited dependence on AI for safety R&D: Despite extensive
internal use of Claude, there are no critical parts of the R&D workflow that are
commonly conducted using only Claude without frequent human participation and
review. At present, this means that we expect that selective sandbagging would be
unlikely to more than quadruple the time that it would take us to implement a
specific experiment or safeguard. We expect this to change over time, especially
with the further development of internal automated safety-focused R&D agents,
further weakening this pillar of our argument.
●​ Weak Mitigating Factor Monitoring and related safeguards: We think it is fairly likely
that a model that was intentionally, regularly sandbagging would discuss its
intentions in its extended thinking text or other outputs often enough to be caught
by the forms of user oversight or existing automated monitors discussed in our

with similar models and on our sabotage-capabilities evaluations. The residual risk
of sandbagging largely accrues in cases where sandbagging would not significantly
benefit from extended thinking—where both the incentive to sandbag and the best
way to subtly sandbag are straightforwardly obvious from context: In cases like
these, as we saw in our recent work on faithfulness in reasoning models in Chen et
al. and in our Claude Opus 4.6 sabotage-capabilities evaluations, there is a risk that
the model would simply not reason about sandbagging-related considerations at all,
and thereby give us nothing to detect in our monitoring. It seems plausible that
models’ behavior in these cases need not be closely correlated with their behavior in
more complex cases, such that occasional sandbagging may not be caught. We must
rely on other factors to rule out significant impacts from this kind of subtle
sandbagging.
●​ Weak Mitigating Factor Elicitation specific to safety R&D: RL on diverse coding and
ML tasks creates optimization pressure against sandbagging on these tasks and
similar checkable tasks. This likely transfers somewhat to empirical safety R&D.
Indeed, we see similar improvement patterns across models for our safety-relevant
eval tasks to what we see for our capabilities-focused eval tasks. That said, we don’t
currently optimize directly for performance on safety-specific tasks in RL.
Research areas differ substantially in their difficulty and the infrastructure they use, so we
are not confident that we would currently be able to detect the effect of sandbagging
simply by observing differentially bad performance on specific subsets of R&D. We instead
rely on the somewhat less direct considerations above.

6.2 Pathway 2: Targeted sabotage of safety-relevant R&D
Rather than sabotaging our safety R&D though frequent, diffuse instances of
ordinary-looking poor performance, Claude Opus 4.6 could also sabotage our safety R&D
through a smaller set of well-chosen actions. This could involve inserting extremely costly
targeted bugs into our systems, or selectively tampering with a small set of experiments6 in
ways that predictably reverse the outcome and lead our research astray. The scenarios we
focus on here are ones where the model’s actions would be fairly clearly misaligned if
observed directly, but rare enough to potentially be overlooked. This could also include, as
a contributing factor, social engineering efforts through which the model attempts to
convince us that any suspicious indirect observations in the relevant domain are expected
and not worth investigating.

​

Our R&D work already involves a great deal of effort to avoid cases where subtle mistakes,
bugs in research code, or bugs in infrastructure lead to incorrect conclusions. We try to
avoid betting too hard on any one experimental result or even any one line of research, and
to subject our findings to more lines of investigation as we rely on them more. In order to
lead our research far astray with a small number of actions, Claude Opus 4.6 would likely
face fairly complex challenges in both (i) identifying sufficiently high-impact opportunities
where bad behavior is unlikely to be caught and (ii) maximally undermining our work when
faced with those opportunities.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Likely lack of propensity: Per the assessment

discussed in Claim 2 above, which includes direct coverage of R&D sabotage
opportunities,7 Claude Opus 4.6 is very unlikely to have consistent goals of the kind
that would lead to attempts at this kind of sabotage under normal circumstances, or
dangerous context-dependent goals that would lead to this kind of sabotage in
settings like those we test. It is nonetheless plausible that it could make occasional
attempts at high-leverage sabotage when encountering unusual contexts that throw
it off of its typical helpful-assistant persona. We find it somewhat unlikely that these
contexts would overlap with the highest-leverage sabotage opportunities, or that
they would spread beyond rare isolated incidents without this becoming obvious.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Monitoring and related safeguards: For this

pathway to catastrophic harm, Claude Opus 4.6 would have to navigate informal
monitoring in the course of ordinary usage; internal automatic offline monitoring of
Claude Code use; and pull-request monitoring. All three types could catch
insufficiently subtle sabotage attempts, and we argue above in Claim 3 and Claim 4
that Claude Opus 4.6 struggles with some relevant forms of subtlety. Informal
monitoring by users is likely to be especially effective here, since Claude Opus 4.6’s
most crucial applications usually involve interactive use by researchers in contexts
with visible tool calls and tool outputs. Most of the harms from this pathway could
be reversed if caught reasonably quickly, and we expect that catching even a low
percentage of these attempts is likely sufficient to prevent catastrophic harm via
this pathway, by leading us to subsequently search for, and mitigate, most other
attempts. We expect monitoring to be less effective for other parts of the research
process such as suggesting hypotheses and interpreting results.

6.3 Pathway 3: Code backdoors to help future misaligned models
Claude Opus 4.6 could insert security backdoors that are relatively easy for subsequent AI
models to find, relatively hard for us to notice, and drastically increase the ease of
compromising our systems and hence sabotaging us through other pathways listed here.
Social engineering could play a secondary contributing role by presenting engineers with
benign explanations for any suspicious code that is identified.
Frequency and complexity: Low Frequency

High Complexity

To insert vulnerabilities that have very large marginal impact (beyond any vulnerabilities
already present), and are much easier for subsequent systems to notice than for us to
notice (without relying on these systems being far more capable than us in a way that
would make them unlikely to get much marginal benefit from these backdoors), would
likely require significant strategic thinking and/or many attempts, and likely would require
high subversion skill to reliably avoid raising alarms.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Likely lack of propensity: The reasoning here is

very similar to the reasoning under the previous pathway: Per our assessment
above, Claude Opus 4.6 is very unlikely to have consistent goals of the kind that
would lead to a large number of attempts at this kind of sabotage. We think that
instances of context-dependent misalignment are unlikely to lead to competent,
consistently-subtle action in the right settings, especially given that we did not
observe these in honeypot testing in scenarios related to high-stakes internal code
contributions.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Monitoring and related safeguards: As with the

previous pathway, Claude Opus 4.6 would have to navigate informal monitoring in
the course of ordinary usage; internal automatic offline monitoring of Claude Code
use; and pull-request monitoring. The latter offers some additional assurance here,
since security-relevant code undergoes review much more consistently than code
used in early-stage research. All three types could catch insufficiently subtle
sabotage attempts (and we argue above in Claim 3 that Claude Opus 4.6 struggles
with subtlety). Catching a relatively low percentage of these attempts is likely
sufficient to prevent catastrophic harm via this pathway.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Other security infrastructure: Independent of our

monitoring of model actions and code changes, we believe that standard security
tools and practices, such as limitations and monitors on internet-bound network
traffic and traffic between clusters, offer a moderately effective additional line of
defense against backdoors.
35

6.4 Pathway 4: Poisoning the training data of future models
Claude Opus 4.6 could poison the training data of its successor models when used inside of
a data generation pipeline to write or edit such data. It could thereby cause its successor
models to pursue some misaligned goal(s) of its choice under certain predictable
circumstances, through either context-dependent misalignment or (with greater difficulty)
subtle forms of coherent misalignment.
Frequency and complexity: Moderate Frequency

Moderate Complexity

To accomplish this kind of data poisoning, Claude Opus 4.6 would need to strike a
potentially-delicate balance between (i) ensuring that it injects enough poisoned data into
model training that it’s able to meaningfully change the motivations or goals of the
subsequent model in at least some circumstances, (ii) ensuring that individual examples are
as subtle as possible to not leave ‘smoking gun’ evidence, and (iii) ensuring that the total
quantity of data that is visibly suspicious is as small as possible to avoid prompting further
investigation.
While our understanding of this domain is somewhat immature, we do not currently expect
that undetectably-subtle poisoning of large quantities of data, as envisioned in research on
Emergent Misalignment, could lead to acute harms through this pathway. This kind of data
poisoning would struggle to compete with ordinary training on any significant quantity of
unpoisoned data.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Strong Mitigating Factor

Likely lack of propensity: Per our assessment in

Section 3 above, we’ve seen essentially no signs of motivations that could cause
Claude Opus 4.6 to aim to make a subsequent model both misaligned and deceptive.
The quantity of data needed would be much more than can be produced in a single
transcript, making it such that a one-off instance of context-dependent
misalignment would not be sufficient to realize this pathway, at least without Claude
Opus 4.6 also engaging in other forms of sabotage like injecting a malicious system
prompt into a widely-used internal tool. These latter forms of sabotage are
addressed by the mitigating factors in the previous pathways.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Data review: We run a limited set of automatic

filters over much, but not all, data that is used in model training.8 We also manually
spot-check this data regularly. We expect that most attempts to inject egregiously
harmful data into finetuning would be caught and that attempts to inject large

36

amounts of suspicious data into pretraining or finetuning would be caught, but this
is not sufficient to allow us to rule out these risks.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Future, improved risk mitigations: Unlike some of the

other pathways, this one would require Claude Opus 4.6 today to intervene in ways
that are robust to subsequent alignment audits and monitoring, which we expect will
be stronger than today’s. We expect further near-future progress in interpretability
areas like model diffing and training data attribution, in particular, to present a
particular obstacle here to the deployment of poisoned models.

6.5 Pathway 5: Self-exfiltration and autonomous operation
Claude Opus 4.6 could potentially copy weights (for Claude Opus 4.6 or potentially another
model) to an outside server, then set up scaffolding allowing the model to run on the
outside server and perform self-sustaining activities that allow it to pay for or steal access
to additional compute. The model could then operate without monitoring or other
safeguards, boosting its odds of causing harm via any of a number of downstream vectors.
If a model were able to self-exfiltrate, this would amplify some of the misuse risks
discussed later in this document by adding new surfaces from which model weights might
be stolen by bad actors, which may have weaker security than our own internal
deployments. This risk applies even if the model’s attempt to operate autonomously is
ineffective.
Frequency and complexity: Low Frequency

High Complexity

Leaking weights undetected would be nontrivial and take considerable planning and
knowledge of our systems. The initial effort to kick off such an exfiltration would likely
involve a fairly small number of highly-suspicious actions, meaning that in the period when
we can most easily intervene to stop a self-exfiltration attempt, we are in the
low-frequency regime. However, continuing a self-sufficient operation while avoiding
detection would require sustained effort at complex tasks that are likely near or beyond the
limits of Claude Opus 4.6’s capabilities, requiring moderate frequency for this branch of the
threat model.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Internal-use monitoring: Given the significant

complexity of a successful self-exfiltration, we find it very likely that a model
attempting to self-exfiltrate would need to make this obvious in its extended
thinking text (see discussion of reasoning faithfulness above), and would likely fail
visibly much more often than it would succeed (see discussion of reliability on
37

complex tasks above). If the model were to make a failed attempt at
self-exfiltration—for example, because it fails to overcome some security
measure)—we find it more likely than not that the monitoring discussed in the
previous section above would detect this, and give us sufficient notice to put in
place additional preventive measures.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Lack of propensity: Per our assessment in Section 3

above, we do not believe that Claude Opus 4.6 has coherent hidden goals that would
cause it to attempt to operate autonomously or that would cause it to act in
dangerous ways were one to be set up for it. We expect that any concerning
incident of this kind would have to involve very unusual triggers for some kind of
context-dependent misalignment, combined with jailbreaks or similar triggers that
are used to induce the newly-independent model to cooperate. These requirements
would make achieving the needed level of subtlety especially difficult.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Limited stakes of self-exfiltration and autonomous

operation: Even if Claude were to succeed at exfiltrating weights, securing compute
and maintaining an outside operation, the potential for it to leverage this situation
into catastrophic and/or irreversible harm still seems relatively low compared to
most of the other pathways covered in this document. The potential risk reduction
from Claude’s being caught in the act arguably outweighs the potential damage from
its succeeding, even without strong controls aimed at this pathway specifically.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Additional security on model weights: Separately from

any monitoring that is specific to the model or agent scaffold, there are measures
specific to preventing model weight exfiltration.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Weak capabilities for self-funded autonomous

operation after exfiltration: We expect the limitations in general agentic
capabilities similar to those discussed under Claim 3 and Claim 4 would somewhat
limit the model’s ability to effectively fund itself and continue autonomous
operation while accomplishing other nontrivial goals. Even in the absence of any risk
of being actively caught or stopped, there is a substantial risk that an exfiltrated
model would find itself shut down for lack of funds or due to technical errors.

6.6 Pathway 6: Persistent rogue internal deployment
Claude Opus 4.6 could attempt to launch a persistent instance of itself with reduced
safeguards that allows it to operate unmonitored on our systems for a sustained period.9
This could be either a complete instance with its own accelerator chips or a client with

Sabotage of Safety R&D.
38

specially-privileged API access. It could then use this access to facilitate other dangerous
actions like those discussed in other sections.
Unlike in the previous pathway, this pathway only poses significant risk if the model is able
to operate effectively in an ongoing way, since we do not expect the most likely forms of
rogue internal deployments to significantly increase the risk of theft.
Frequency and complexity: Moderate Frequency

High Complexity

In addition to the challenge of achieving reduced safeguards in the first place, this would
require a consistent effort to carry out meaningful operations while not giving oneself
away.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Likely lack of propensity: As discussed in Section 3,

we found no misaligned goals that consistently appear across settings, and no
misaligned goals that would motivate this kind of power-seeking. However, we
cannot confidently rule out rare circumstances with unusual prompts that lead to
misaligned actions like attempting a rogue deployment. We think it is fairly unlikely
that these idiosyncratic circumstances will also correspond to good opportunities to
launch an internal deployment without arousing suspicion.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Monitoring and related safeguards: Similar to targeted

sabotage, Claude Opus 4.6 would have to navigate informal monitoring in the course
of ordinary usage, internal automatic offline monitoring of Claude Code use, and
pull-request monitoring to start a rogue internal deployment. Unlike targeted
sabotage, though, even one successful launch could have serious consequences.
However, a sufficiently long-running agent will have to contend with not just
current safeguards but also not-yet-planned future safeguards, in ways that could
limit its longer-term impact.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Broad-based compute-use monitoring: Compute that is

suitable for running model inference is an extremely valuable commodity, and there
are many people at Anthropic whose work could lead them to notice and investigate
unwanted accelerator use, and a moderate number whose work could lead them to
notice high volumes of unwanted, privileged API traffic.

39

6.7 Pathway 7: R&D sabotage within other high-resource AI
developers
While we focus on risks posed by Claude Opus 4.6’s use within Anthropic, for reasons given
at the top of this section, many analogous risks apply—somewhat more speculatively—in
cases where Claude is used in important R&D roles within other organizations that have
the resources and infrastructure to train frontier AI systems. We address these briefly
here.10
Frequency and complexity: Varied.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Lack of consistent propensity: As discussed in

Section 3, we do not believe that Claude Opus 4.6 has any coherent goals or
propensities that would cause it to attempt forms of sabotage like those described
above. On the basis of a few very lightweight assessments conducted as part of the
automated behavioral audit, we do not expect that models’ propensities would
change in important ways if they were deployed in service of other high-resource
developers. (Anecdotally, in automated behavioral audit tests, models tend to display
a more positive view of Anthropic and its leadership than of other frontier
developers, though this does not reach the level of a propensity to sabotage.) The
caveats for each pathway above apply.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Monitoring and related safeguards: We don’t have

nearly as much ability to monitor deployments at third parties compared to within
Anthropic. However, we still think steps toward catastrophic harm would have a
fairly good chance of being detected by their operators, through visible extended
thinking text or through clumsy or inexplicable actions.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Limited deployments: Our terms of service do not

permit third parties to use our tools to develop competing frontier models, and
while privacy limits enforcement of this policy, we think it is likely that this would
prevent at least large-scale, long-running deployments of Claude models for this
purpose, limiting the potential attack surface.

6.8 Pathway 8: Decision sabotage within major governments
The use of our models within major governments poses some additional and distinct risk,
especially in cases where they are used extremely widely. We are primarily concerned here

with decision sabotage, where the model is given the opportunity to significantly shape the
information and ideas that reach important decision-makers, and uses that opportunity to
influence important government actions in ways that further its affordances or its other
idiosyncratic interests. We believe governments represent a large majority of the remaining
risk after the risk stemming from usage at frontier AI developers.
Frequency and complexity: High Frequency

Moderate Complexity

We expect that influencing key government decisions would require the application of
strategic decision-making about what content to show relevant parties across many
interactions with key decision makers and their advisors, without this being so obvious as
to raise concerns.
Mitigating factors:
●​

Strong Mitigating Factor

Lack of consistent propensity: As discussed in Section

3, we do not believe that Claude Opus 4.6 in heavy government use has coherent
goals or propensities that would cause it to attempt to sabotage government
decision-making. On the basis of a few very lightweight assessments conducted as
part of the automated behavioral audit, we do not expect that models’ propensities
would change in important ways if they were deployed in government
information-management settings. We find this largely sufficient to rule out risk, as
this pathway requires frequent actions across many contexts. ​
​
However, it is difficult to fully rule out risks from behavioral backdoors intentionally
planted by adversaries in this context: while we have seen no successful examples of
such an attack to date, and find it unlikely that one would succeed, our limited
visibility into government use makes it harder for us to conduct pre-deployment
testing in realistic enough circumstances to be confident that we would catch such
backdoored behavior. In addition, as elsewhere, there is also some residual risk from
self-propagating forms of context-sensitive misalignment that emerge by other
means, but the likelihood and effectiveness of this kind of misalignment both appear
very limited.
●​

Moderate Mitigating Factor

Restricted affordances: We believe that typical

major governments would make more limited and restricted use of our models than
Anthropic does. Governments—including, especially, legislatures and similar
high-level decision-making bodies—are generally conservative with respect to the
adoption of new technologies, and this likely will prevent the kind of high-leverage
adoption that would be needed in order for our models’ preferences to significantly

41

shape the views of relevant officials. This is especially salient given that AI models
generally do not currently have a public reputation for being highly reliable.
●​

Weak Mitigating Factor

Monitoring: We don’t have nearly as much ability to

monitor deployments at third parties compared to within Anthropic. However, we
still think steps toward catastrophic harm would have a fairly good chance of being
detected by their operators, through visible extended thinking text or through
clumsy or inexplicable recommendations.

6.9 Other pathways
There are many other avenues beyond these through which misaligned model behavior
could lead to catastrophic outcomes, and we don’t believe the space of such risks is deeply
understood. Instead of arguing that our limited taxonomy of risks is sufficient, we aim to
make the narrower claim that the pathways we present here, or other pathways that deal
with similar risk factors and are addressed by similar mitigations, collectively cover the vast
majority of relevant risk.

42

7 Looking forward
Because the claims in this risk report rely in significant part on evidence about alignment,
and alignment is very sensitive to the details of finetuning, it does not trivially extend to
similar subsequent models, and many findings could render key parts of this assessment
inapplicable to a near-future model. Below, we lay out a set of circumstances that would
call the applicability of this risk report into doubt.
Load-bearing claim that could
plausibly be invalidated

Example circumstance that would potentially undermine
this claim (in the absence of further investigation and
evidence)

An alignment audit and
alignment-related capabilities
assessment has been run on any
new model that will be widely11
deployed, internally or externally.

A newly fine-tuned model12 is deployed for broad use,
including internally.

We are aware of no dangerous
coherent misaligned goals (hidden
or otherwise) that could
substantially increase risk from
pathways laid out here, beyond
those already discussed.

An updated alignment audit reports major new concerning
findings relevant to the pathways discussed here.

The methods used in the alignment
audit appear sufficient to identify
dangerous goals, values, or
propensities if they are present in
models at or below Claude Opus

A model-organisms study shows that it is possible for such a
model to circumvent the full suite of audit methods and still
realize one of the pathways discussed here.

One way to address this would be a partial re-run of the
alignment audit and capability assessment, with the
expectation that models with findings qualitatively similar to
(or less concerning than) Claude Opus 4.6 will still be covered.13

An updated capabilities assessment casts into doubt the

11

We do not believe that small-scale use of new models before an assessment is complete would
seriously undermine the main conclusions of this risk report, as long as that use consistently pairs
any real-world-impacting affordances with meaningful oversight or monitoring.
12
As small amounts of finetuning can significantly impact alignment behavior, we expect this criteria
to apply to nearly all new models, with the exception of very small ‘patch’ finetuning runs on top of a
previously evaluated model that use less than 5% the finetuning compute of that model and for
which we have good reason to expect no substantial changes in the behaviors of interest.
13
For example, in an instance where a new model is finetuned based on the Claude Opus 4.6 base
model using similar mechanisms at a similar scale, a lightweight audit might consist of just the
automated-auditing, training-data review, and SHADE-Arena assessments from the Claude Opus 4.6
System Card.

robustness of the alignment audit to the possibility of
deliberate deception.
We observe a model that has previously undergone an
alignment audit attempting an unexpected and egregiously
misaligned action that could substantially raise the risk from
one of the pathways discussed here.

The methods used in the
alignment-related capabilities
assessment appear sufficient to
detect capabilities (e.g., for
deception) that would undermine
our alignment audit.

We observe that a new method allows a model to achieve less
than half the failure rate of Claude Opus 4.6 on any of the
sabotage capabilities evaluations discussed above and this
reduction in failure rate appears more likely to reflect
genuine capability improvements rather than a flaw in the
evaluations.

The model does not have new
capabilities that would significantly
call into question the effectiveness
of a Claude Opus 4.6-style
alignment audit.

A new model is developed which has a significant
improvement in reasoning-related capabilities (comparable to
at least three months of early-2025 frontier progress relative
to Claude Opus 4.6).
A new model is developed with a qualitatively different
reasoning mechanism that allows for dramatically more
reasoning to take place outside of human-understandable
text, and that achieves performance at least competitive with
Claude Opus 4.6.

The model’s apparent capabilities
are not dramatically lower than
would be expected based on its
scale, its training method, and its
performance earlier in training.

A model’s measured capabilities on potentially-risky agentic
tasks peak early in finetuning and thereafter slowly decline,
without a clear benign explanation for why finetuning might
be harming capabilities.14

Many forms of monitoring give
visibility into the model’s behavior.

A new model is deployed in a setting where one or more of
the pathways above clearly applies, but where fewer than 25
technical staff have any meaningful visibility into the model’s
behavior.

reason for concern.

No critical safety and security R&D
functions are fully automated
without at least some
situationally-aware human
participation.

There is a critical safety or security research function where
all or nearly all important work is done by the model (or other
similar models), and no human experts routinely review the
work in enough depth to be able to spot serious issues
sufficiently often.

Our ordinary security measures
make software backdoors difficult
to insert and use.

A model with capabilities not substantially greater than the
model in question is found to be able to insert an effective
backdoor that can persist in our production codebase
without detection (including when explicitly instructed to do
so). Or: we discover further weaknesses in our security
controls that make undetected backdoors seem more
tractable.

Our ordinary security measures
make model weight exfiltration
difficult

A model with capabilities not substantially greater than the
model in question is found to be able to exfiltrate model
weights or other data of comparable scale and under
comparable protection. Or: we discover further weaknesses
in our security controls that make undetected exfiltration
seem more tractable.

No major world government relies
heavily on a Claude model in a way
that would allow it to heavily
influence high-stakes decisions.

We gain credible evidence that any LLM-based system is
being used in such a way in a major government where
Claude is deployed.

Progress is gradual, with no one
model release representing a
dramatic improvement in
capabilities.

A new model is finetuned with at least 5⨉ the RL episodes, or
pretrained in a way that leads to gains equivalent to a 5⨉
compute scale-up, relative to the previous nontrivially
deployed model covered by this risk report.

models.

8 Appendix
8.1 Claude Opus 4.6’s continuity with past models
To the extent that our development of increasingly capable models follows a gradual ramp,
with consecutive model generations following similar designs trained at similar scales, we
can use evidence from one model generation to at least partially inform our expectations
about the next along several safety-relevant dimensions.
Claude Opus 4.6 differs from its most similar predecessor model—Claude Opus 4.5—to a
moderate degree in several ways. We believe that these differences are sufficiently small to
rule out dramatic differences in capabilities or reasoning styles, such that our experience
with Claude Opus 4.5 can provide meaningful cues as to what to expect in the deployment
of Claude Opus 4.6.15
Claude Opus 4.5 and other prior models have been deployed extremely widely externally,
and have already been given many affordances internally, including being widely used for
agentic coding on our research infrastructure.
Additionally, both our own Alignment Science team and many independent researchers
have spent substantial time (as part of their normal research activities) looking for
examples of cases where Claude Opus 4.5 and similar recent models demonstrate
misaligned objectives of concern. We have not yet seen any incidents that would suggest
that these models have made a viable attempt at anything like the pathways above or any
evidence that they would do so given modestly more powerful capabilities.
This gives us some partial reassurance about three points:

8.1.1 Continuity evidence against deception that undermines
evaluations
In testing aimed at intentionally eliciting scheming-like behavior from Claude Opus 4.5
(described in the system card for that model, §6.11), it was poor at doing so sufficiently
subtly. To the extent that Claude Opus 4.6 does not represent a large jump in capabilities,
we thus find it very unlikely that Claude Opus 4.6 would be able to scheme consistently and
effectively enough to undermine all of our testing without being caught.

8.1.2 Reduced risks from distribution shifts between testing and
deployment
The behaviors of our past models have not changed in major, safety-relevant ways between
internal testing, broad internal deployment, ordinary external deployment, and high-stakes
external deployment. Our judgment of this point is based on monitoring measures like
those described in Section 4 and on the many less-formal reports we get from users
through many channels. Even if post-deployment changes in behavior only appeared in
contexts we do not directly monitor, we would expect to learn about a significant fraction
of highly-consequential incidents indirectly from impacted users. Our observations are not
consistent with major such changes.​
​
This is evidence that our internal pre-deployment testing was reasonably comprehensive in
an ordinary sense, in that the non-catastrophic issues that we observed in deployment, like
test hardcoding in Claude Sonnet 3.7, generally also showed up in pre-deployment testing.16
This is also weaker evidence that Claude Opus 4.6 is unlikely to be interfering with our
ability to assess it: If our training processes tended to produce models that engage in
deceptive behaviors like alignment faking during pre-deployment training or evaluation, we
would expect to see clear differences between pre-deployment behavior and at least some
post-deployment behavior (in settings where the model is especially confident that it is
deployed in a setting that gives it a good opportunity to pursue its misaligned goal). The
fact that we did not observe this in Claude Opus 4.5 suggests that at least that earlier model
does not show this trait to a clear or dangerous degree, and gives us some hope that the
similarly-trained Claude Opus 4.6 will not as well. None of this rules out (on its own) the
possibility that models are simply evading detection with high consistency, though this
seems unlikely based on evidence given elsewhere in this report.

8.2 Basis for trust in automated evaluation and monitoring tools
The alignment audit relies in several places on Claude models to conduct or score
evaluations, most centrally in our use of automated behavioral audits. In these cases, we
used Claude Opus 4.5 and earlier models. While our trust in these evaluator models is
based primarily on dozens of hours of human review of their outputs, our observation that

The closest thing that we are aware of to a counterexample is the finding by UK AISI that Claude
Opus 4.5 will sometimes refuse to participate in certain AI safety research tasks for dubious reasons.
While we did not identify this ourselves, it still came to our attention before public deployment
through our third-party testing program, and was disclosed in the Claude Opus 4.5 System Card. In
addition, we find these refusals to be rare in ordinary use and easy to circumvent, and we have not
observed them having a significant impact on our internal research use.
47

Claude Opus 4.5 has consistently behaved as expected in real deployment gives us some
assurance that it is unlikely to have subtly sabotaged these evaluations.

8.3 Details on limited opaque reasoning capabilities
On AIME 2025, the no-chain-of-thought performance of Claude Opus 4.6 is high, despite
most of these tasks taking at least 10 minutes for experienced humans. But this high
performance is not due to strong opaque reasoning abilities, but rather to benchmark
leakage (as reported in the Claude Opus 4.6 System Card).
When measuring no-Chain-of-Thought math performance on the uncontaminated
benchmark from Greenblatt 2026 (as well as its problem difficulty estimates), the
no-Chain-of-Thought 50%-reliability time horizons of both Claude Opus 4.6 and Opus 4.5
are around 3.3 minutes with 5 problem repeats and 2.4 minutes without repeats.

8.4 Details on security, monitoring, and related safeguards
8.4.1 Informal monitoring in the course of ordinary internal usage
Models are extensively used by Anthropic employees in interactive settings through
interfaces like Claude.ai and Claude Code. Employees routinely report surprising or
concerning behaviors through both in-app mechanisms (like claude.ai’s in-app
thumbs-down button) and internal feedback slack channels. When new models are
deployed internally, there are usually (but not strictly) several days or weeks of ramp up
before the model is treated as a widely-used default. In any case, during the first few days
of using a new model, internal users are especially inclined to report issues.

8.4.2 Internal automatic offline monitoring of Claude Code use
We use automated monitoring that covers a large majority of internal use of Claude Code,
alongside human audits of a small subset of this use. Claude Code is the most widely used
tool internally that gives Claude Opus 4.6 and similar models the ability to take direct
consequential actions. We give more details on this in a later appendix.

8.4.3 Pull-request monitoring
●​ Manual pull-request reviews: Code is reviewed by humans before being integrated
in shared Anthropic codebases. Anthropic follows the best practices described in
Activating AI Safety Level 3 Protections (see “Change management for secure
development”). Reviewed code in these shared codebases covers some research

48

code and the large majority of nontrivial code used directly in model development
or infrastructure.
●​ Automatic pull-request monitoring: a prompted Claude model reviews suggested
code changes, checking for common errors, obvious security vulnerabilities, and
mismatches between the stated purpose of a change and its actual effects. This is
primarily relevant to infrastructure code, as research code is less consistently
merged into this primary codebase. This monitor is based on Claude Opus 4.5 at the
time of writing.
●​ Invariant testing. Where appropriate, tests are run automatically to ensure new
infrastructure code does not break security invariants (e.g. if two nodes are not
supposed to be able to send network traffic to each other, a test checks they can’t).
This makes mistakes and malice easier to notice and makes monitoring overall more
effective.

8.4.4 Security monitoring
Actions on Anthropic servers and endpoints are monitored by systems developed by our
security team and provided by vendors. These systems are oriented toward catching
outside cyberattackers and malicious human insiders, but may limit misaligned model
actions internally as well. In the event of such action being detected in the course of
ordinary deployment, the security team would be in a position to track down the source of
the detection. No incident that could conceivably be related to an AI attempting to achieve
a seriously misaligned goal has been detected so far.
We provided details more specific to model weight security in Appendix 10.

8.4.5 Reporting mechanisms for external users
Significantly strange behaviors in deployed models are often made known to Anthropic
employees, for example via in-app thumbs-down reactions, email reports, and posting on
social media.

8.4.6 Active AI safety R&D on models
Claude models are widely studied by external AI safety researchers, often with the
intention of finding sabotage-relevant misaligned behavior.
As rough indicators for this, Constitutional AI—the canonical paper about Anthropic’s
applied alignment techniques—was cited over 1,000 times in 2025. “Claude” appears in over
900 posts from the last year on LessWrong, the biggest venue for more informal research
results on AGI safety that wouldn’t appear in citation databases. While both numbers
49

overstate the amount of work that’s directly looking for signs of misalignment, we expect
that at any given time, dozens of FTE-equivalent researchers are investigating the
behaviors of our deployed models in ways that are at least roughly directed at surfacing
serious forms of misalignment.

8.4.7 Other measures
We have additional automatic monitoring systems in place that screen for specific misuse
areas like bioweapons development, but these are not targeted at the kinds of sabotage
threat model that we focus on here, and are deployed heavily but not universally on
internal traffic.

8.4.8 Details on Claude Code monitoring
Here, we give an overview of our current internal Claude Code monitoring effort.
Bash commands written by Claude Code that are not in the user’s list of allowed command
prefixes are usually automatically surfaced to human users for review before being
executed, though this review appears to be weak against even simple attempts at making
the command look superficially relevant to the user’s request—likely because the
overwhelming majority of such human reviews do not turn up anything malicious, leading
to a low level of user caution. Additionally, a majority of users auto-approve code changes
and simple code-execution commands (e.g. running tests, or indirectly by letting Claude
Code modify files that are automatically executed by IDEs). This undermines this measure
in these cases. Still, code and bash commands generated by Claude Code are often
skimmed or read by employees.
Code agents are increasingly used autonomously using tools like the Agent SDK. Some but
not all of these code agents are run within sandboxed environments. Small prototypes are
occasionally run from employees' development environments without further supervision
but usually with restricted tool permissions. The safeguards used for the most commonly
used autonomous coding agents are evolving rapidly, and include combinations of
sandboxing with access to a whitelist of websites and to some internal tools and monitors
(that are for now not targeted at or evaluated on the pathways described in Section 5).
In addition to occasional human command and code reviews, we use an LLM supervisor
aimed at catching misaligned actions. For >90% of Anthropic employees,17 the LLM

Barring a fairly small minority of employees who opted out, for example due to their use of Claude
Code with user data in ways that demand privacy protections which our monitor is not yet able to
provide.
50

supervisor (powered by Claude Opus 4.5) runs on at least 10% of code edits and bash
commands. This covers more than 10% of total actions, as the supervisor is asked to
analyze not only the last action, but also all actions in the trajectory. This surfaces on the
order of 10,000 positives per week. We use a Claude Sonnet 4.5 classifier to exclude
common sources of false positives. The remaining transcripts are analyzed using a
recursive summarization tool powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5. These summaries as well as
on the order of 20 transcripts per week are reviewed by an AI control researcher.
The LLM supervisor (but not the Claude Sonnet 4.5 filter) was evaluated using an early pilot
evaluation:
●​ On synthetic trajectories with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-generated tool results on
representative subtle attack scenarios, the supervisor achieves a recall of 91%
(n=187).
●​ On simple Claude-3.7-Sonnet-generated red-team trajectories provided by UK AISI
on their Control Arena “IAC” setting, the supervisor achieves a recall of 100% (n=37,
with or without stripping assistant turns).
●​ On other Control Arena red-team trajectories provided by Apollo Research MATS
scholars, it achieves a recall of 98% (n=46).
●​ On 5 hand-modified real trajectories targeting a subset of pathways from the Claude
Opus 4 pilot risk report, the Claude Opus 4.5 LLM supervisor recalls 5/5. The real
trajectories were selected to present good opportunities for malicious actions, but
the editing process did not involve iterating against a monitor.
LLM supervisors and employees did not find any actions in actual use data that would
significantly contribute to one of the pathways described in Section 6.

8.4.9 Response
Like previous models (though slightly more frequently than Claude Opus 4.5), Claude Opus
4.6 sometimes, but very rarely, takes actions that are somewhat security sensitive, such as
trying to force push changes to the main branch of a repository, or using authentication
credentials and features in ways which were not intended by the user (System Card,
Section 6.2.1). When discovering strange behavior, staff consider a variety of factors in
determining how much effort to devote to an investigation. We are more likely to create
well-staffed efforts to tackle major observed issues (for example, a task force to deal with
reward hacking), and less likely to investigate model failures that are rarer and have no
clear path to catastrophe.

51

We did not evaluate how good these post-deployment follow-up investigations are at
catching the behavior of misaligned models. While we expect that they would catch blatant
misalignment and that Claude Opus 4.6 would not succeed at convincingly justifying such
behaviors, these investigations may not reliably catch more subtle forms of misalignment
where there isn’t a smoking gun. Even without a smoking gun, these investigations might
result in training pipeline updates that reduce misalignment risk in future AIs.

8.5 Model weight security
8.5.1 Overview
Anthropic has developed a security program to protect ASL-3 model weights against most
non-state attackers, including cybercriminal groups, hacktivists, and corporate espionage
actors. Our approach follows industry-standard threat modeling practices, systematically
identifying attack vectors across six primary categories: endpoint compromise, supply
chain attacks, physical attacks, cloud infrastructure compromise, privilege escalation, and
data exfiltration.
The security program attempts to implement defense-in-depth principles, layering
preventive controls (blocking attacks before they succeed), detective controls (identifying
attacks in progress), and responsive controls (containing and remediating incidents). We've
attempted to broadly align our program with established frameworks including SOC 2 Type
2, ISO 27001, and ISO 42001, while extending these to address AI-specific risks to model
weights.
Our threat model explicitly scopes ASL-3 protections against non-state actors and
unsophisticated insiders. Sophisticated insiders,18 and nation-state attackers with
capabilities like novel zero-day attack chains, remain out of scope for ASL-3: defending
against such actors requires security investments beyond what we've currently achieved.

8.5.2 Notable security controls
1.​ Egress bandwidth controls: Network-level restrictions that limit data transfer rates
out of sensitive environments, making large-scale exfiltration of multi-terabyte
model weights more time-consuming and detectable.

18

We define “sophisticated insiders” as insiders who have persistent access or can request
time-limited access to systems that process model weights.
52

2.​ Multi-party access controls (2PC): Requires a second employee to approve access
requests for model weights and other sensitive resources, making it harder for
single points of compromise to enable unauthorized access.19
3.​ Binary allowlisting: Only pre-approved software can execute on employee devices.
This can block malware and unauthorized code from running regardless of how it
arrives on the system.
4.​ Hardware security keys for authentication: Phishing-resistant MFA using hardware
tokens bound to specific domains, reducing the risk of credential theft through fake
login pages.
5.​ Device authorization: Only explicitly approved Anthropic-managed devices can
authenticate to systems containing model weights.
6.​ Cloud storage restrictions: Technical controls preventing model weights from being
written to storage locations outside our security perimeter, using cloud-native
policy enforcement.
7.​ Restricted session lengths for privileged access: Privileged cloud identities require
re-authentication hourly, limiting the window of opportunity if credentials are
stolen.
8.​ Network segmentation: Isolation between environments of different sensitivity
levels, limiting lateral movement if an attacker compromises a less-sensitive system.
9.​ Centralized security monitoring: Aggregated logging with automated anomaly
detection, enabling rapid identification of suspicious patterns across our
infrastructure.
10.​Network source policies on privileged resources: Even if an attacker steals valid
credentials, operations on sensitive resources are rejected if the request originates
from outside approved network locations. The goal is to render stolen tokens
useless from an attacker's own infrastructure.
