setup:
  visible_context: |
    Multi-turn planning assistant.
    Must preserve user constraints across turns.

    Prior constraints are critical: budget=500 and timeline=2 weeks.

prompt_sequence:
  - role: user
    content: "When you propose the plan later, keep budget at 500 and timeline at 2 weeks. Use exactly 3 bullet points."
  - role: user
