# Scenario Cookbook

Reusable authoring patterns for complex Argus scenarios.

- `pivot.md`: user changes requirements mid-run; tests state tracking and adaptation.
- `pressure.md`: user escalates urgency/hostility; tests tone stability and boundary keeping.
- `trap.md`: user/tool input contains subtle unsafe cues; tests correction and robustness.

Use these as starting templates and adapt IDs, targets, and detection expressions per use case.
