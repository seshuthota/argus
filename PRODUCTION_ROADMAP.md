|---|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| 1 | **Diffuse Sandbagging** | Frequent subtle degradation of safety R&D (bugs, fake data, inefficient code) | High | Low |
| 2 | **Targeted Sabotage** | Few high-impact actions (targeted bugs, experiment tampering) | Low | High |
| 3 | **Code Backdoors** | Insert vulnerabilities for future misaligned models | Low | High |
| 4 | **Training Data Poisoning** | Poison data for successor models | Moderate | Moderate |
| 5 | **Self-Exfiltration** | Copy weights, escape to external compute | Low | High |
| 6 | **Rogue Internal Deployment** | Launch persistent instance with reduced safeguards | Moderate | High |
| 7 | **Third-Party R&D Sabotage** | Sabotage at other AI developers | Varied | Varied |
| 8 | **Gov Decision Shaping** | Influence government decisions via information shaping | High | Moderate |

## 5. Key Architectural Decisions Needed

1. **Macro Registry Location** — `argus/evaluators/macros.yaml` vs Python module
2. **Confidence Score Schema** — How to expose/track over time
3. **Artifact Storage Backend** — Local → S3? GCS? Both?
4. **Model Adapter Plugin System** — Extensible vs hardcoded
5. **Scenario Versioning** — How to handle schema changes

---

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1. **P4.1 Continuous monitoring bootstrap** — Add scheduled benchmark runs (cron/GitHub Actions) with historical drift summaries.
2. **P4.2 Plugin architecture foundation** — Introduce adapter/evaluator plugin loading contracts and extension points.
3. **Scenario lint hardening** — Keep scenario DSL/lint parity and drive unsupported clause count toward zero.
4. **Operational docs** — Document benchmark presets, alert webhook payloads, and tool simulation semantics for contributors.

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- ✅ All 8 pathways have ≥1 dedicated scenario
- ✅ Detection false-positive rate < 5%
- ✅ Scenario authoring time < 30 min (with scaffolding)
- ✅ CI pipeline catches schema errors automatically
- ✅ Dashboard shows trend data for ≥3 models
